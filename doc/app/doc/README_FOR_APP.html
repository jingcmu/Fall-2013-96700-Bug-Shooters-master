<p>Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful
places in the API for learning more. Run “rake doc:app” to generate API
documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.</p>

<p>This app is used for tracking and estimating projects. The name of the app
is “Process Enactment Tool”. In the home page, we have a Sign up form which
allows a new user to sign up for this website. We also have a sign in link
which allows the signed up users to log in. <a href="../User.html">User</a>
has to provide name, password and email address to sign up. While signing
in, user has to provide email address and password.We have added validation
tests for name, format of email password - length, type etc. Once the user
signs in,we allow the user to view his/projects by clicking on My projects
link. <a href="../User.html">User</a> can also create a <a
href="../Project.html">Project</a> by clicking on the New <a
href="../Project.html">Project</a> link in /projects page. The user has to
provide name, description and the lifecycle type of the project. We have
added validation tests in our model which prevents the user from creating a
project without a name and a description. Also, user cannot create projects
having the same name.User can choose a lifecycle from a pre-populated list
of lifecycles using dropdown menu and create a project. <a
href="../User.html">User</a> can also edit and delete a project. Once the
user creates a project, it takes him/her to the projectshow page where
details of the created project are displayed. Here, the name, description
and lifecycle of the project is displayed. The user is allowed to choose a
project phase depending on the chosen lifecycle type. Based on chosen
lifecycle type in the previous page, the dropdown menu for the project
phase autopopulates. <a href="../User.html">User</a> can select a phase
from this dropdown box. <a href="../Project.html">Project</a> phase is an
instance of the lifecycle phase which is dependent on type of chosen
lifecycle.</p>

<p>Once the user chooses the project phase, he/she will be directed to view
phase page which will display the chosen lifecycle, project phase , name of
the project and the description of the phase. It also populates a dropdown
box which lists all the associated deliverable types with the phase. <a
href="../User.html">User</a> can choose a specific deliverable type from
the dropdown list or choose the “Other” option. Choosing “Other” in the
dropdown list takes the user to create adhoc-deliverables page whereas
choosing any other listed deliverable type takes the user to the create
deliverable page. <a href="../User.html">User</a> can input the name,
description, complexity, unit of measure, estimated size, estimated effort
and estimated production rate in this page. If any 2 of the values amongst
estimated size, estimated effort and estimated production rate are input,
the third one is autocalculated(javascript is used to achieve this
functionality).We have added validation tests such that user will not be
able to create a deliverable without providing the name or description.</p>

<p>In the create deliverables page, we allow the user to view the historical
data for a given complexity and size to provide a relative idea about the
size of the deliverable. In the create adhoc-deliverable page, we do not
provide any historical data.</p>

<p>We have a View all deliverables link in view project(/projects/:id) page
which lists out all the deliverables for the particular project along with
their estimated effort. In this page, user can log actual effort spent in
working on that deliverable. <a href="../User.html">User</a> can also edit
and delete deliverables and logged effort for the deliverables.</p>

<p>We have also added an administrator to our website. The Administrator has
the ability to view, edit and delete a project belonging to any user. The
administrator can also assign projects to users.(The idea is that
Administrator represents the project manager. <a
href="../User.html">User</a> represents the developer. The project manager
can assign projects to users)A normal user can only view his/her projects
and perform operations on the same.</p>

<p>We have deployed our app onto Heroku. URL : <a

deliverables, user cannot modify the deliverable type associated with it
